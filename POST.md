I just shipped HWInfo TUI (a terminal UI for monitoring HWInfo sensors) in less than 24 hours using AI-assisted development.

Here's how the future of software development actually works:

🧠 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻-𝗔𝗜 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽:
 • Me: Vision, architecture decisions, quality control
 • GitHub Copilot (GPT-5): Research, specification refinement
 • Claude (Sonnet 4): Full implementation from specs

⚡ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀:
 1️⃣ Vision First: Researched gping's approach, defined clear requirements
 2️⃣ Specification-Driven: Used AI to create comprehensive specs (no code yet!)
 3️⃣ One-Shot Implementation: Fed complete specs to Claude → received fully functional app
 4️⃣ Human Quality Control: Tested, refined UX, ensured code quality
 5️⃣ Production Ready: AI generated complete CI/CD pipeline for PyPI + Windows distribution

🎯 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁: 𝗔 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻-𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘆 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵:
 • Real-time CSV monitoring with file watching
 • Rich terminal UI with interactive charts
 • Dual-axis plotting for mixed sensor units
 • Complete CLI with fuzzy sensor matching
 • Automated publishing to PyPI and Windows Package Manager

💡 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁: This isn't about replacing developers - it's about amplifying human creativity. I spent my time on vision, user experience, and strategic decisions while AI handled the systematic implementation work.

Traditional estimate: 2-3 weeks 
Actual time: 12-16 hours across 2-3 nights

The future is collaborative intelligence: human creativity guided by AI capability.
